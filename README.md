Visualization of Super Store Dataset sales analysis using Power BI

I'm thrilled to share my most recent project, which uses Power BI to analyze Super store sales data . I was able to extract, transform, and clean sales data from Kaggle.com. Data about Order ID,Order Date, Ship Date,Ship Mode, Customer ID, Customer Name, Segment,	Country/Region,	City, State,	Postal_Code,	Region,	Product ID	Category	Sub-Category	Product Name	Sales	Quantity	Discount	Profit

I was able to standardize and clean the data using data transformation technologies, ensuring that all of the data was correct and trustworthy. The calculations option was useful for figuring out various performance indicators for Sales in regions and sales based on categories.
